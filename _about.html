                        <h5>They say that the most empowering outcomes can arise from the most challenging journeys and the discovery of Smart Cleanse is no exception. </h5>

<p>  Savannah Daisley is the founder of Smart Cleanse and the website smartcleanse.com.au. While Savannah has enjoyed the benefits of exceptional health and wellbeing for a number of years now, this wasn’t always the case in her younger years.</p>

<p>  “After having a childhood wrought with junk food (toxic food), to becoming the resident mojito (cocktail with mint, lime and sugar in it) girl in my 20’s, I manifested some pretty tough imbalances in my body over the years.</p>

<p>  While I was polluting my body with toxins, the food allergies I had became worse, and in particular my vitality and energy levels really took a nose dive, sometimes for days. This soon became the norm for me, and it was also accompanied by a constant headache, which lasted for a full five years.</p>

<p>  This was no way to live. It was some time later that I went to a lecture where I met with the now famous Cellular Biologist Dr Bruce Lipton of Stanford University Medical School USA, who shared his research findings that 95% of disease was caused by toxins, stress and negative beliefs (perception).</p>

                    </div> <!-- .et_pb_column --><div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_1_3">
                    <div class="et_pb_text et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left">
                        <p>You know that life-changing moment when that light bulb switches on and everything goes quiet? Well that moment then was the beginning of my interest in detoxification and the inspiration behind forming Smart Cleanse.”</p>

<p>  After realising that detoxification, stress management, re-programming self-limiting beliefs, and eating totally organically gave her optimum health, Savannah researched and developed the Premium <a href="http://www.smartcleanse.com.au">Naturopathic Detox Program</a> ‘14 Day Smart Cleanse’, with the vision of helping people around the world embrace the power of health and vitality.</p>

<p>  She is the author of ‘14 Day Smart Cleanse,&#8217; the comprehensive instruction manual that accompanies the Detox Kit, and the author of an upcoming book based on ‘Epigenetics’, the latest on health, and how stress and toxins have a detrimental effect on cell function and structure.</p>

<p>  Over a number of years, Savannah has helped thousands of people detoxify their bodies, lose weight, heal their digestion, improve strength and fitness, eliminate stress, reverse the ageing process, overcome various adverse health conditions through the benefits of detoxification, and is passionate about doing so.</p>
