So much so that people noticed & stopped me to ask what I was doing differently. I sleep better now, I’m calmer & more relaxed, my tummy isn’t bloated anymore, my mind is clear & I’ve lost a total of 4 kilos*. I love Smart Cleanse™ & highly recommend this program to anyone.”

I didn’t feel good in myself and then a friend told me about their weight loss and experience on Smart Cleanse™. I gave it a good go, and was astounded at my results. In the first 14 days, I lost 8 kilos of body fat* and my sugar obsession completely vanished, as I replaced it with the low GI organic foods recommended. After the Detox, I moved onto stage 2 weight loss and then maintenance, and after 8 weeks I lost 17 kilos*, and have effortlessly kept it off! I am so grateful. I even fit into my old clothes again!”

I tried contraceptive pills, harmful retinols, prescriptions, and even laser surgery procedures with no luck. My libido was low, and I felt emotionally unstable, with bouts of anxiety coming about for what seemed like no logical reason. After 14 Days on Smart Cleanse™ my symptoms began to diminish, and not long after my face cleared up! I was able to look in the mirror with confidence again and regained my sense of inner peace and balance. I felt like 'me' again!

                                <p>Just wanted to let you know I finished the detox on Friday evening last week.  Week 2 was much easier than week 1 and I definitely lost a couple of kilos*, largely I think in week 2.  It’s just a matter of keeping them off and I think including protein in my diet, cutting out sugar and reducing carbs, was the answer. I felt clearer and more focused afterward too. Another outcome is that I seem to be very indifferent to coffee now. I’m no longer craving caffeine, so thankfully my daily latte may become a thing of the past too! I’m waking up earlier, feel happier, and have so much more energy in general. Thanks Smart Cleanse™! </p>

                                <p>Before starting Smart Cleanse™, I was often bloated and uncomfortable after meals - even when they were healthy! Through the Smart Cleanse Program, I came to understand more about a healthy gut and what it takes to maintain this. After too many years of excessive sugar intake, it was almost impossible to restore my digestive system back to good health without some help. Smart Cleanse™ has helped me focus on clearer, healthier living - without the horrible bloated feeling. My body feels like it’s working the way it was intended to. Thank you Smart Cleanse™!</p>

The results speak for themselves and right now I’m feeling way above average. By Day 7 I was pretty pleased 3.2kg down, body fat 1.2 % down, bust, waist, hips and thighs all 3.5 cms down!

                                <p>Day 5 today, lost 2kgs! Didn’t do it for the weight loss but happy all the same. I wasn’t even following the weight loss menu. I ate normally and yet the weight came off. Thanks Smart Cleanse.</p>

                                <p>Day 7 and I’ve lost 3.5kgs. I haven’t had this much energy in a long time. This cleanse has bought me back to eating 3 meals a day and rarely snacking.</p>

                                <p>I have just completed the 14 Day Smart Cleanse & I must say I was quite impressed. It comes with comprehensive info & diet/meal plan for weight loss including recipes. The first week is Gut cleanse & the second Liver. It is powders & capsules taken twice a day, which I find much easier than 3 times daily. The powders are not what I would call delicious, but not unpleasant, and all the ingredients make sense to me as a pharmacist. I have lost at least 3kg & more importantly I feel great. I have more energy and am much more clear in the head. I haven't had a headache since day 3, and I was getting a lot before starting. 
I would definitely recommend it.
The only detox I have tried before made me really sick, so this was a very pleasant surprise.

                                <p>I lost 5kgs using the smart cleanse system. The first week was particularly hard as all of the bad were being flushed from my system but week 2 my skin glowed, my energy levels were high and I felt absolutely amazing. My weight had plateaued before Smart Cleanse and it certainly kick started weight loss again. Now I just need to maintain the healthy habits that I learnt from the system. I would recommend anyone that wants to feel better about themselves both inside and out try it!  </p>

Except the clay but you can't win them all smile emoticon
Stay strong everyone!! The results are worth it. Thanks as always Savannah for kick starting great habits and for developing the cleanse that makes me feel like a new person!</p>
