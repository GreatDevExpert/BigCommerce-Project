homes and offices.</h5>

<p>  <b>What is Detoxification?</b> Detoxification is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism. In other words, it’s the act of flushing toxins out of your body so that 

you can regain a better balance of health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>  The internal organs that are involved in detoxification include your liver, kidneys, lungs, colon, lymphatic system and (outwardly) your skin – all of which can become polluted and sluggish with constant 

exposure to environmental (air, food, water) and metabolic toxins (toxins produced by your body internally).</p>

<p>  As you can imagine, the constant circulation of these toxins takes its toll on your system, which is working overtime to eliminate them. Just think how exhausting this is when your are overloaded with toxins 

every day.</p>

<p>  The Smart Cleanse <b>detoxification program</b> uses a smart approach to support these organs by assisting them to remove toxins from your body safely and efficiently with our <a
