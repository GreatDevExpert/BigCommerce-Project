                                    <p>Headaches can indicate many things, but most commonly in this case could be either because you have come off caffeine too suddenly, or because toxins are being released for elimination into your bloodstream. I recommend that you drink plenty of purified water in between meals, perhaps have half a shot of caffeine just for 1 or 2 days, so your vascular system has time to adjust to the changes (caffeine constricts arterioles in your system, so when you avoid it, vasodilation of arterioles produces a headache). I always recommend before commencing a Detox Program, that strictly avoids caffeine, to gradually wean yourself off caffeine 3-4 days prior. In severe cases you may need to cease the program and seek medical advice.</p>

                                    <p>No refined salt or table salt is allowed as salt can cause adverse health effects. However, a small amount, 2/5 of a teaspoon of organic sea salt, Pink Himalayan, or Celtic Sea Salt, should be used daily. It is actually very rich in minerals, and our body requires unrefined salt for health. There is a big difference between the white easy to pour table salt, and natural untouched salt, that hasn’t been tampered with.</p>
